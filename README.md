# Excercises

Hi! I'm Javier Chevalley and welcome to my GitHub.

The goal of this page is to showcase my programming and data analysis skills, so recruiters interested on my profile can corroborate my capabilities in those subjects.

Here I'll be uploading excercises I do as part of courses curriculums, or just por practicing purposes, as I complete them.
The database and questions are provided by the excercise itelsf, while the code uploaded is always written by me.

I also invite you to check my Linkedin profile in case you happened to get here by any other means, at: https://www.linkedin.com/in/chevalley-javier/.

Thank you for stopping by!
